    "In symmetric key encryption, Bob and Alice each encrypt their message, each using their own secret key that they have agreed upon \"out of channel\". For example, assume that the duo are texting one another using the encrypted messages. They would have first had to have agreed upon their secret keys via a phone call or written letter, prior to engaing in encrypted conversation via text messaging. This is called symmetric key encryption, as the key used to encrypted the message is the same key as the one used to decrypt the message. \n",

    "One can imagine the utility of this approach, which allows two individuals to agree upon a protocol for encryption, but without having to establish a key or list of keys, which could ultimately be compromised. You'll note that three pass protocol encryption is technically a subform of symmetric key encryption, as the keys used to encrypt and decrypt are the same numbers. But, it is mathematically curious to see the commutative property of mathematics \"in action\", and for that reason, we will explore this as a useful venture in cryptography from that perspective.\n",

    "As suggested by the name, the three pass protocol requires three \"passes\" of the message. Use the code block below to explore the three pass encryption protocol. Once you have explored how this code block works, see if you can improve upon it by assigning each pass to a function, and then creating new lines of code that call upon a \"main function\" that invokes the three functions for each pass (and a final function for decryption). \n",
