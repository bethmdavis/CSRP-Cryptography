This is useful, as it complicates attacks wherein someone tries to guess the key by evaluating different potential keys using the characters in a message.\n",

Here, the key generated is a 32-byte encryption key, which is used in AES-256 encryption. AES-256 encryption is a stnadard encryption method accepted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. \n",
